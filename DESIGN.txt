--Action--
executeAction
executeAnimationAction
executeActivityAction
(The three functions listed above were moved to Action because the Action regulates what the entities do in
the virtual world. When an action is occurring, the Action class should be controlling it.)

--EventScheduler--
scheduleActions
scheduleEvent
unscheduleAllEvents
removePendingEvents
(EventScheduler regulates and schedules actions, so these functions clearly belong in EventScheduler.)

(It wasn't immediately clear what these methods do. However they involve the organization and movement of
entities. I put them in EventScheduler because it broadly controls what is happening in the world.)



--WorldModel--
moveToCrab
load
processLine
(Both of these functions were somewhat ambigous. Howeve they took WorldModel as a parameter so were moved to the class.
Additionally these functions involve determining what is part of the world, and WorldModel keeps track of what is in the world.)

findOpenAronud
(Moved to WorldModel because this function deals with the entities inside the world.)

getCurrentImage
(Moved to WorldModel because it deals with the background image)

nearestEntity
(Moved to WorldModel because it deals with the entities in the world.)
keys for entities: world model



--Entity--
executeOctoFullActivity
executeOctoNotFullActivity
executeFishActivity
executeCrabActivity
executeQuakeActivity
executeAtlantisActivity
executeSgrassActivity
(The above functions were all moved to the class Entity. Entity regulates what each entity is doing at any given
point in time, so it will be in charge of executing the activities of the indiviudal objects.)
scheduleActions
getCurrentImage
transformNotFull
transformFull
moveToNotFull
moveToFull

(This function was moved to WorldModel because WorldModel regulates where entities are in relation to one
another.)

nextPositionOcto
nextPositionCrab
(Both moved to Entity class because the functions deal with the behavior of specific entities.)

createAnimationAction
(This function was somewhat abmiguous. However I moved it to Entity because it involves the behavior of entities.)


--Point--
adjacent
(Moved to Point because it only involves this class)


--ImageStore--
getImageList
loadImages
processImageLine
getImages
(These functions were all moved to ImageStore because they involve the collection and processing of images used in the
game. ImageStore keeps track of them.)


--VirtualWorld--
parseBackground
parseOcto
parseObstacle
parseFish
parseAtlantis
parseSgrass
(These functions were difficult to place. VirtualWorld already contained a the function parseCommandLine which implied
that it would be involved in parsing. VirtualWorld largely deals with the data involved in the game, so it made sense
to include parsing, or data processing, in this class.)
